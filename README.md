============

GHPython Mesh Analysis Components.

Mesh analysis components used for form found tensile membrane design in the AAC Amphibious Hamburg in June/July 2014 in Hamburg. Workshop hosted and tutored by CITA, GMP and AAC.

The Python components are in the Grasshopper file in the "examples" folder above. It is probably easiest to simple download the whole branch as a zip file (here to the right) and extract the .gha from this.
